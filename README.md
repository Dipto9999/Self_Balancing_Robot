## Overview

We designed an autonomously balancing two-wheel robot with wireless BLE control. Our robot prioritizes safety and security, featuring environmental detection (obstacles, color recognition) and RFID authentication, in addition to a live camera feed.

## Robot Firmware

### [Arduino](Arduino_Firmware)

- Maintains balance using PID controller tuned via BLE.
- Sensor fusion using a complementary filter combining accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- PID loop runs in the main program loop for maximum timing control.
- Motor control with PWM slow decay via DRV8833.
- Prioritizes balance over movement; directional movement is achieved by injecting temporary angle offsets.

### [STM32](STM32_Firmware)

- Handles auxiliary features to reduce load on Arduino.
- **Distance Sensing**: Triggers GPIO signal to Arduino on proximity.
- **Color Detection**: Triggers alert when red is detected.
- **RFID Authentication**: Verifies UID and signals Arduino on success.
- **Buzzer**: Alerts on successful scans, errors, or warnings via PWM tone generation.

## User Software

### [Driver App](Driver_App)

- Flask-based BLE controller hosted via **ngrok** for mobile access.
- Provides UI buttons for movement: FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT.
- Handles pairing authentication invisibly to end user.

### [Dashboard App](Dashboard_App)

- Python GUI with live camera stream (Tkinter).
- Snapshot and recording functionality with automatic upload to AWS S3.
- Camera runs at ~20 FPS with reduced resolution for performance on Pi Zero 2 W.
